1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

* Making coffee;

A:

FUNCTION
  IF coffee maker equals on
    Turn coffee maker off
  ENDIF
  WHILE water reservoir water level does not equal full
    Add water to reservoir
  ENDWHILE
  IF filter basket does not contain filter
    Add filter to filter basket
  ENDIF
  WHILE filter contents does not equal 4 Tbsps coffee
    Add coffee to filter
  ENDWHILE
  IF coffee maker equals off
    Turn coffee maker on
  ENDIF
  IF coffee maker does not equal brew
    Turn coffee maker to brew
  ENDIF
  WHILE coffee maker equals brew
    Wait
  ENDWHILE 

* Washing dishes;

FUNCTION
  WHILE water level in sink does not equal ¾ full
    Add water to sink
  ENDWHILE
  IF water does not equal soapy
    Add soap to water
  ENDIF
  IF sponge equal dry
    Wet sponge
  END IF
  WHILE there are dirty dishes
    FOR EACH dish
      Scrub with sponge
      Rinse with tap water
      Place on drying rack
    ENDFOR
  ENDWHILE
  IF sink does not equal empty
    Drain sink
  ENDIF
    
A:

* A choice of your own. MAking bread in a bread machine

SET Recipe (Ingredient 1, Ingredient 2, Ingredient 3, Ingredient 4, Ingredient 5)

FUNCTION
  IF bread machine equals on
   Turn off bread machine
  ELSE
   Remove pan from bread machine
  ENDIF
  FOR each Ingredient in Recipe
    IF Ingredient does not equal Ingredient in pan
      Add ingredient to pan
    ENDIF
    Return pan to bread machine
  ENDFOR
  IF bread machine does not equal on
    Turn on bread machine
  ENDIF
  IF bread machine does not equal bake
    Turn bread machine to bake
  END IF
  WHILE bread machine equals bake
    Wait
  ENDWHILE

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

A: Netflix has an algorithm that recommends what to watch based on your previous viewing history and the view history of millions of other users. They try to figure out what you might want to watch next based on what other people in your demographic have watched in the past. This has really changed how people watch television. Instead of channel surfing, people are presented with several viewing options that are catered to their specific tastes.

Facebook has an algorithm that recommends friends based on your current circle of friends. Their simple algorithm tries to connect people by counting the number of similar friends between two non friends. The likelihood of a new friend being recommended to you is proportionate to the number of friends you have in common. While this algorithm is not especially complex, the popularity of Facebook makes it especially important.

UPS has algorithm that removes all most all left turns from their navigation systems. Left turns can cause delays, especially in larger cities, and can also be hazardous as they expose the driver to oncoming traffic. Not to mention the fuel that is wasted by waiting for traffic during peak travel hours. UPS’s system removes left turns and replaces them with three rights. Their algorithm has saved the company millions of dollars in fuel alone and cut carbon emissions drastically.


3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

A: An efficient algorithm should contain a set of logical steps that do not deviate from the ultimate goal. Each step should be clear and concise, leading to a goal that can be reached within a finite time frame. 

An inefficient algorithm deviates from the expected logical steps. It may reach the ultimate goal but it’s path is not as clear as an efficient algorithm. There may be extra steps or there may be steps that have been omitted entirely. These factors could make the algorithm slow to execute and the algorithm could possibly arrive at the wrong conclusion.
